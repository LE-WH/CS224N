Decision tree
====

discrete input -> categorizing

> 1. Calculate the entropy
> 2. Try a dividing method based on exact values
> 3. And then calculate the entropy reduction.
> 4. Repeat 2 and 3 until we get a best division. Now we get a tree node.
> 5. Repeat 2.3.4 until we're satisfied with the tree.
