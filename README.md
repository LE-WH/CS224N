# CS224N
Assignments and notes

Currently I have finished a1, a2, a3, a4, and theoretical part of a5.

You can check what I have done in: 

- exploring_word_vectors.ipynb for a1
- pdf files for a2 and a3.
- not really much to show in a4. You may check the code.
- pdf files for a5. Note that I only finished the first math part.

And I also put some of my notes here. I started writing notes during Lecture 7, only to put down the catalog of what I've learned from the course.

- note_NLP.md is the note for CS224N
- note_ML.md is the note for Machine Learning in Action by Peter Harrington 

They're pretty concise.
